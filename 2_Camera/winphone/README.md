Camera Explorer
===============

This application is built by modifying the (extremely useful) Nokia
[Camera Explorer](https://github.com/nokia-developer/camera-explorer) app.

Our modified application was built for an ongoing research project, it is not
remotely production-quality, but should build and run correctly at least on
Lumia-brand phones, if not all Windows Phones.

The additions that our app makes are:
 * The ability to upload (POST) pictures to a url
 * Show the full range of Lumia-powered camera settings (requires Nokia-specific API)
 * A 'continous-sample' mode that will take and upload pictures as fast as it can

The remainder of this README is from the original Nokia project and should be
sufficient to get things up an running.
